# Ascendant – System Structure (Working Concept)

## 1. Core Idea

**Ascendant** is a universal progression system for individual athletes across many sports.

Athletes do not compete *in Ascendant* by default. Instead, they:

* Train
* Compete in existing sports
* Earn achievements and XP
* Progress through levels in multiple skill domains

Ascendant measures **capability over time**, not single-event performance.

---

## 2. Athlete Identity

* Everyone is an **Ascendant**
* Athletes have **levels** in multiple domains
* No one chooses a specialization
* Strengths emerge from activity

Example:

* Speed: B3
* Skill: A1
* Endurance: F7
* Prime: C2 (derived)

---

## 3. Domains (formerly Archetypes)

Domains represent broad physical capabilities. Sports map into these domains.

### Domains (current set)

* **Strength** – force, load, work capacity
* **Skill** – coordination, control, precision (ninja / parkour)
* **Endurance** – long-duration effort
* **Speed** – acceleration, sprinting, fast output
* **Cycle** – cyclic power (cycling, rowing, etc.)
* **Prime** – overall balance (calculated, not trained directly)

Domains are intentionally broad and future-proof.

---

## 4. Level System

Each domain uses the same level structure.

**Letters:**
F → E → D → C → B → A → S

Each letter contains **0–9** sublevels.

Examples:

* C7 Skill
* B2 Speed
* A0 Endurance

Levels update continuously based on XP.

### Rank Names (The Ascendant Ladder)

| Rank | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|--------|
| **F** | Foundation | Learning the basics. Building the base. |
| **E** | Explorer | Trying new skills. Expanding capability. |
| **D** | Disciplined | Training with intent. Showing consistency. |
| **C** | Challenger | Taking on real tests. Pushing limits. |
| **B** | Breakthrough | Major capability unlocked. |
| **A** | Apex | Advanced performance. |
| **S** | Supreme | Exceptional. Rare. |

Rank names give meaning to progression beyond just letters.

## 5. XP (Experience Points)

XP is earned through:

* Training
* Testing
* Competitions
* Events

XP:

* Always accumulates
* Never expires
* Is domain-specific

XP alone cannot unlock a new letter rank.

---

## 6. Breakthrough System (Letter Advancement)

To move from one letter to the next (e.g., C → B), an athlete must complete a **Breakthrough**.

### Key rules:

* XP continues accumulating even if a breakthrough is not yet completed
* XP is capped visually at the top of the letter (e.g., C9)
* When the breakthrough is completed, banked XP is applied immediately
* Athlete jumps forward multiple sublevels (dopamine hit)

Breakthroughs represent **demonstrated capability**, not volume of work.

---

## 7. Breakthrough Structure (High-Level)

Breakthroughs are organized by **categories**, not specific equipment or obstacles.

Each domain:

* Has multiple capability categories
* Requires **coverage**, not specialization

To advance a letter:

* Athlete completes **N of M categories** at that rank
* Categories are general and gym-agnostic

Exact categories and standards are defined per domain and per age group.

---

## 8. Age Adjustment

* Breakthrough standards are age-adjusted
* Ranks remain consistent across ages
* Difficulty scales, meaning does not

A child and an adult can both be “B Skill,” via different standards.

---

## 9. Sports Integration

Sports feed XP into domains.

Examples:

* Ninja / Parkour → Skill
* OCR → Endurance + Strength + Skill
* Ultra running → Endurance
* Sprint races → Speed
* Cycling / MTB → Cycle

Sports do not define rank; they contribute to it.

---

## 10. Competitions

Competitions act as **XP accelerators**.

General flow:

* Event mapped to one or more domains
* All participants earn base XP
* Placement earns bonus XP using **percentile**, not raw place

Competition results never directly set rank.

---

## 11. Prime Domain

Prime represents **overall athletic balance**.

* Calculated from other domains
* Cannot be trained directly
* Rewards well-rounded development

Prime progression slows at higher levels by design.

---

## 12. App Role

The Ascendant app:

* Tracks XP and levels
* Records breakthroughs
* Stores athlete history
* Integrates gym and event results
* Shows strengths, gaps, and next goals

The app is the continuity layer across sports.

---

## 13. Guiding Principles

* Capability over specialization
* Progress over podiums
* Standards over vibes
* Gym-agnostic design
* Kid-friendly, adult-serious

> XP shows effort. Breakthroughs show capability.
